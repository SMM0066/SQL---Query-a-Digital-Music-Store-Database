# SQL---Query-a-Digital-Music-Store-Database
Udacity Project

In this project I queried the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. I wrote SQL queries to ask questions about the media, the artists, customers, employees, and the sales. Using the pulled data, I made a presentation to present the answeres supported by visualizations.
